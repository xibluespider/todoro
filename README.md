## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the help and inspiration from various resources. I would like to express my gratitude to all who have supported me in my journey, especially to the people who teach and explain on YouTube, StackOverflow, GitHub discussions, and Reddit, as well as those responsible for documentation works and libraries.
